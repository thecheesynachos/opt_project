    "\n",
    "One of the issues about election processes is the problem of drawing fair voting districts. Fair voting districts could be defined as one where the representatives that are chosen by the election matches as closely to the actual voter behaviours of the actual populations as possible. An example can be seen in the diagram below labelled (b), where there are just over one-third green voters, and the districts are divided such that one of the three districts are won by green voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The opposite action of drawing fair voting districts is gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is an act of manipulating the boundaries of election districts such that it favours one of the parties. There are two main ways that political parties can gerrymander to favour their own parties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Cracking_ - the process of assigning similar voters to different districts so that they form a minority in the different districts and cannot win the election. This is a useful technique for parties with *majority* voters. This is demonstrated in the diagram below labelled (a), where the green voters are distributed amongst the different districts and becomes a minority group in all of the districts.\n",
    "- _Packing_ - the process of grouping similar voters together so that there could be some districts which contain only like-minded voters, and leave other districts more competitive with less of such voters. This is a useful technique for parties with *minority* voters. This is demonstrated by the diagram below labelled (c), where the blue voters are all grouped in one district, leaving the rest of the blue voters a minority group in the other districts.\n",

    "\n",
    "(_Image above taken from_ https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Gerrymandering_9-6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, these districts will be very carefully crafted in order to achieve the cracking or packing desired. They can change the outcome of elections without actually having to change the behaviours of voters themselves. There exists examples of electoral districts in the United States where gerrymandering is present. An example include a district in North Carolina which groups voters of similar race together in the same district \n",

    "(_Image above taken from_ https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/North_Carolina_12th_Congressional_District_%28National_Atlas%29.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of ways of countering gerrymandering, such as to use computer algorithms which would draw voting districts of similar population sizes while disregarding the demographics of the people entirely (which may create unfair voting districts but would be by pure chances), or to set up independent committees who may draw voting districts such that it considers the demographics and make it more fair (which is what we will do).\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify how fair a voting district is, we can use the concept of *wasted votes*, which are votes that is either\n",
    "- For the minority party, or\n",
    "- For the majority party above what they need in order to get the majority in the district (i.e. if a party gets 70 out of 100 possible votes in an area, they have 19 wasted votes because they only need 51 to get a majority there, so 19 of the votes is just extra).\n",
    "Quantitiatively, a fair voting district is one with the lowest *efficiency gap*, which (assuming we are in a two-party system) is the difference between the wasted votes of the two parties divided the number of total votes. If there is gerrymandering for a certain party, the efficiency gap will be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will devise different methods of drawing voting districts given a smaller, self-generated sample population model in order to minimise the efficiency gap, or to make the voting districts as fair as possible. Population model will be generated both purely randomly, and with a model which creates clusters of similar voters. We will experiment with drawing district shapes by dividing town into \"blocks\" and assigning each of these blocks to a different district, and also by drawing straight lines and divide a town into slices. We will also experiment with an alternative objective of the problem where we aim to gerrymander the districts such that it is in favour of one of the two parties in the election, by trying to maximise the number of districts won by one of the parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "After devising a model, we will discuss the general geometry of the districts that is drawn and also compare how the model performs against each other in terms of running time and minimal efficiency gap that we are able to get.\n",

    "### 2.1 Population Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, exact voting behaviours of people living in certain locations cannot be determined, but they are rather guessed according to the demographics of the population (i.e. by gender, race, age, education, etc.). However, for the purpose of our problem, we will generate our own sets of data which will represent the exact voting behaviours of people at given locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define some variables regarding our model of the city as follows.\n",
    "- Let the city be a square shaped of size $n$ by $n$.\n",
    "- Assume the city is bipartisan, i.e. only consisting of two parties. We will have two types of voters, one who will intend to vote for Party A and one which will vote for Party B. Let $Anum$ be the number of voters for Party A, and $Bnum$ be the number of voters for Party B. We also define $vts$ to be $Anum + Bnum$ for convienience. For our model, it doesn't matter which party has majority voters or minority voters.\n",
    "- Assume we want to divide the city into some number of districts defined by the parameter $dist$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generate the voter distribution by generating the location a certain voter will be at. There are two schemes we can use to generate these voters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustered Voters Distribution ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we select two points to be the \"focus\" point for the voters of Party A and for Party B. We then use the `randn()` command on Julia and generate a random number based on the normal distribution, where the mean is at the \"focus\" point and the standard deviation is determined by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since `randn()` only generates a number from the normal distribution centred at zero and with a standard deviation of 1, to generate a random point for our voters we need to manipulate the randomly generated number. The mathematical expression for the randomly generated point for the voter in Party A is given by \n",
    "$$ \\Big( sdv_A \\cdot \\texttt{randn()} + x_{A},  \\quad sdv_A \\cdot \\texttt{randn()} + y_{A} \\Big)$$\n",
    "while the generated point for the minority voter is given by \n",
    "$$ \\Big( sdv_B \\cdot \\texttt{randn()} + x_{B},  \\quad sdv_B \\cdot \\texttt{randn()} + y_{B} \\Big)$$\n",
    "where $sdv_A$ and $sdv_B$ are the standard deviations for distribution for the two types of voters, and $(x_{A}, y_{A})$ and $(x_{B}, y_{B})$ are the focus points for the majority and the minority voters respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Voters Distribution ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scheme, the coordinates of the voters are generated randomly using the `rand()` command on Julia. The coordinate of a voter would be generated by the expression \n",
    "$$ \\Big( n \\cdot \\texttt{rand()},  \\quad  n \\cdot \\texttt{rand()} \\Big)$$\n",
    "where the factor of $n$ is multiplied since `rand()` only generates numbers between 0 and 1. The probability that the voters is at any location in the town is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In larger towns, this model is more unrealistic as similar voters will tend to cluster together in real life. However this model will still provide an interesting case for our problem when analysing the limits of the models and how well it can draw district lines when there are no clear patterns in the voters distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will store the coordinates of the voters in arrays called $Alist$ and $Blist$, where the coordinate of the $i$th voter of the A party is $(Alist[i,1], Alist[i,2])$ and the coordinate of the $j$th voter of the B party is $(Blist[j,1], Blist[j,2])$."

    "### 2.2 Drawing Voting Districts ###\n",
    "\n",
    "When we assign the voters to a district, there are a couple of constraints that we have to take into account. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The voters cannot be assigned to more than one district.\n",
    "2. The number of voters in a district must be roughly equal. Since it is not practical to make the size of all districts be equal to each other, we can use some parameter $pd$ which will be the maximum percentage difference between actual district size and the ideal district size (which is equal to total voters divided by the number of districts).\n",
    "3. A certain district must be connected and isn't split into two parts (i.e. you can walk between two points in the district without leaving the district - the city doesn't have to be convex though). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider the voting districts being drawn in three ways (as you will also see my level of creativity in naming the schemes isn't that high). We will have to ensure that the conditions above are satisfied. Many of the constraints in the models will be repeated because the same conditions above must be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the models below are mixed integer programs (MIP).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1. Block Assignment Scheme without Graphs ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In the block assignment scheme, we divide the town into $blk \\times blk$ blocks. We then assign each of the blocks to a certain district, keeping in mind the conditions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a city of some size. We will divide them into blocks and label their coordinates so it looks something like the image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/blk1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To record how many of each voters are in each of the blocks, we define a new set of variables. We will define two new arrays $Ablock$ and $Bblock$, where $Ablock[i,j]$ and $Bblock[i,j]$ are the number of voters of Party A and Party B in block $(i,j)$. These two arrays can be formed by looping through each voters in $Alist$ and $Blist$ and figuring out which block the voters will have to be in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the block assignment, we define a variable $X$ where \n",
    "$$X[i,j,k] = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 \\quad \\text{if block $(i,j)$ is in district $k$,}\\\\\n",
    "0 \\quad \\text{if otherwise.} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "Because a block can only be allocated to one district this means that we have the constraint $\\sum_{k=1}^{dist} X[i,j,k] = 1$ for all blocks $(i,j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also define some extra variables which will constrain our districts further. These are:\n",
    "- $vA[i]$ which are the number of votes for Party A in district $i$,\n",
    "- $vB[i]$ which are the number of votes for Party B in district $i$,\n",
    "- $voters[i]$ which is just the total voters in district $i$, or equal to $vA[i] + vB[i]$,\n",
    "- $xedge[i,j,k]$ which is 1 if blocks $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ are allocated to district $k$ and is 0 otherwise,\n",
    "- $yedge[i,j,k]$ which is 1 if blocks $(i,j)$ and $(i,j+1)$ are allocated to district $k$ and is 0 otherwise,\n",
    "- $Awon[i]$ which is 1 if Party A wins election in district $i$ and is 0 otherwise,\n",
    "- $Bwon[i]$ which is 1 if Party B wins election in district $i$ and is 0 otherwise,\n",
    "- $wA[i]$ which is the number of wasted votes by Party A in district $i$,\n",
    "- $wB[i]$ which is the number of wasted votes by Party B in district $i$,\n",
    "- $gap$ which is the absolute difference between wasted votes of the two parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we need these variables will become apparent when we discuss the rest of the formulation of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we have to do is to work out the number of voters belonging to each of the district. This can be done simply using the variable $X$. To find the number of Party A voters in some district $k$, we can sum the expression $X[i,j,k] \\cdot Ablock[i,j,k]$ over all $i$ and $j$. This will be $vA[i]$. An analogous summation of $X[i,j,k] \\cdot Bblock[i,j,k]$ over all $i$ and $j$ would give us the total Party B voters in district $k$. This will be $vB[i]$. From this, we can also say the total voters in a district is given by $voters[i] = vA[i] + vb[i]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of each district must be about the same. We defined the variable $pd$ representing the maximum deviation allowed in district size. If all districts were equal then there will be $\\dfrac{vts}{dist}$ voters in each district. With the error factors, one district can have between $\\Big(\\dfrac{vts}{dist}\\Big)(1-pd)$ and $\\Big(\\dfrac{vts}{dist}\\Big)(1+pd)$ voters. This results in the constraint $\\Big(\\dfrac{vts}{dist}\\Big)(1-pd) \\leq voters[i] \\leq \\Big(\\dfrac{vts}{dist}\\Big)(1+pd)$ for all districts $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find the total number of voters in each party, we can find out which party won each district. This can be done by comparing values in $vA$ and $vB$ with each other. We say that for a district $i$, Party A won ($Awon[i] = 1$, $Bwon[i] = 0$) iff $vA[i] > vB[i]$ or iff $vA[i] \\geq vB[i] + 1$, and Party B won ($Awon[i] = 0$, $Bwon[i] = 1$) iff $vA[i] < vB[i]$ or iff $vA[i] + 1 \\leq vB[i]$. Note that we will ensure a strictly greater/less than constraint so that we do not have any ties in the election and so each district will have one definite winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce the two conditions above, we can say that $vA[i] - vB[i] - 1 \\geq -mar\\cdot Bwon[i]$ and $-vA[i] + vB[i] - 1 \\geq -mar\\cdot Awon[i]$ where $mar = \\Big(\\dfrac{vts}{dist}\\Big)(1+pd)$ which is the maxmimum winning margin possible in a district given possible size of a district. The two constraints above are logic constraints. We can also impose a further constraint that $Awon[i] + Bwon[i] = 1$ to ensure that there must be exactly one winner in a given district.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the number of wasted votes from each party, we remind ourselves that wasted votes are either votes for the losing party or votes on top of what was needed to win. So as an example, consider the wasted votes for Party A in district $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If they lost in district $i$, then the wasted votes will be the total votes in district $i$ for Party A. This value will be $vA[i]$. This term will only matter when Party B wins or $Bwon[i]=1$.\n",
    "- If they won in district $i$, then the wasted votes will be the votes above the majority needed. The number of votes needed for majority can be said to be half of the total votes in the district, or $\\dfrac{voters[i]}{2}$ (we will not use the \"half-plus-one\" majority method because we'd need to distinguish between odd or even number of voters in the district which complicates the problem further without increased precision in solution). So the wasted votes in this case will be $vA[i] - \\dfrac{voters[i]}{2}$. This term will only matter when Prty A wins or $Awon[i]=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can say the total wasted votes for Party A in district $i$ is given by $vA[i]\\cdot Bwon[i] + Awon[i]\\Big( vA[i] - \\dfrac{voters[i]}{2}\\Big)$. We can see that only one of the two term in the expression will contribute to wasted votes depending on who won in the district. For the total number of wasted votes $wA$ across all districts we sum this term over all $i$. An analogous method can be used to find the wasted votes for Party B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We finally can define the efficiency gap of our model. As a reminder, the efficiency gap is the difference between wasted votes of the two parties, divided by the total number of votes. Mathematically, this means that $gap = \\dfrac{\\left| wA-wB \\right|}{vts}$. To code this in Julia, this means that $gap \\geq \\dfrac{wA-wB}{vts}$ and $gap \\geq \\dfrac{wB-wA}{vts}$. This value must be minimised in our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still have to ensure that our district is connected. For this scheme, we will do so empirically by making connectivity of districts be another objective. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the variables $xedge$ and $yedge$. We remind ourselves that $xedge[i,j,k]$ is only 1 if district $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ are both in district $k$. As a constraint this means that $2\\cdot xedge[i,j,k] \\leq X[i,j,k] + X[i+1,j,k]$. We also have $yedge[i,j,k]$ is only 1 if district $(i,j)$ and $(i,j+1)$ are both in district $k$. As a constraint this means that $2\\cdot yedge[i,j,k] \\leq X[i,j,k] + X[i,j+1,k]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the districts are more separated then not many terms in $xedge$ and $yedge$ will be 1 because not many neighbouring blocks are of the same district. If the districts are mostly connected, more edges will satisfy conditions above, and more terms in $xedge$ and $yedge$ will be 1. So if we want districts that are mostly connected, we will want $conn = \\sum_{i,j,k} xedge[i,j,k] + \\sum_{i,j,k} yedge[i,j,k]$ to be as high as possible. This can be treated as another objective we need. \n",
    "\n",
    "So our overall objective consists of two parts - part which minimises efficiency gap and the part which maximises connectivity of districts. So our objective would be to minimise $gap - bias\\cdot conn$, where $bias \\geq 0$ is the bias factor on how much we care about connected districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model of our optimisation is therefore\n",

Then that means at $x=0$ and at $x=n$, the point on line $m$ must be below line $m+1$, or $m$ must have a lower $y$ coordinate than line $m+1$ at the two points of $x$. We can enforce this constraint by saying that $yint[m] \\leq yint[m+1]$ and $n\\cdot slp[m] + yint[m] \\leq n\\cdot slp[m+1] + yint[m+1]$ for all $m = 1,...,dist-1$.\n",

This can be contrasted with the block scheme without graphs which has got an objective that promotes neighbouring blocks to be of the same district (hence produces more rounded groups of blocks in the same district), or with the line drawing scheme which will produce convex solutions anyway due to the geometry of straight lines."

    "\n",
    "Since the time taken to solve the problem with the two block schemes (with and without graph) is expected to depend on the value of $blk$ (i.e. number of constraints and number of variables will depend on $blk$), we can try to compare their performances directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test the speed of the two graph schemes, we can run the model for different values of the available parameters. We let the parameters be the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the clustered voter distribution,\n",
    "- $n$ be values $[15, 20, 25, 30, 35]$,\n",
    "- $Anum = 2n^2/5$ and $Bnum = Anum/2$ (where we assume that population density of the city is about the same, so population scales with area, or with $n^2$, and we also let there be a majority party and a minority party),\n",
    "- $dist=3$,\n",
    "- $pd = 0.2$,\n",
    "- $sdv_A = sdv_B = n/2$,\n",
    "- $x_{A}=y_{A}=n/5$ and $x_{B}=y_{B}=4n/5$,\n",
    "- $blk = n/5$ which means that the blocks in all samples will have a size of 5, which is a block small enough that we generally will get no infeasible problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We run each model with a certain parameter value 10 times and take the average. The graph of the results is as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/res1.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the block scheme which doesn't use graphs tend to be quicker than the scheme using graphs. However, what was surprising was that the speed for both models seem to be increasing at around the same exponential rate (as seen by the rough slope of the graph). This shows that while using graphs does result in longer computation times, it is not that much longer (less than an order of magnitude longer).\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph also seems like it may intersect at a point, which may suggest that there is a point where the model with graphs will overtake the model without graphs. However this shouldn't be drawn as a definite conclusion until further analysis is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that all 10 iterations of the models for certain parameters were run all in one sitting, which may affect how fast the code runs (compared to if the notebook was started fresh and the code is then run, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also note that it is harder to compare the graph schemes against the line scheme though, since the time to solve the problem using the line scheme mainly depend on the number of total voters (which directly influences the number of constraints). We expect that the time to solve the problem using the line scheme will grow much quicker than the time used to solve with the block scheme since in real life, the total number of voters would grow quicker than the number of blocks we choose to divide the voters into.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2. Efficiency Gap ####\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also test to see which models is able to complete the objective the best. To test this, we can use the same parameters as above and run it against all of the three models (we can now compare all three methods directly since we are not interested in the time it takes to come up with such values, only their efficiency gap). Here are the results we achieve.\n",

    "We can see that the efficiency gap achieved by block model with graph and by the line model is mostly the same for the different cases. This suggests that the two schemes here tend to produce the fairest districts, and that there isn't a specific scheme that gives a better answer than the other but rather both will give equally good answers as long as you give the districts drawn enough degrees of freedom to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are a couple of points that should be mentioned about this conclusion. Firstly, in the block model without graphs, a better value for $bias$ could have been chosen to get a better efficiency gap (see next section). We have not taken this fact into consideration for this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, in reality, the actual amount of efficiency gap will not matter too much. In real elections, what matters most is that the demographics of the population is represented equally, which would be fulfilled if the proprtion of winning district matches as close to the proportion of population as possible. All three schemes produces a solution that is \"good enough\", and so to get the lowest possible efficiency gap would not be necessary in real life applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.3. Variation of $bias$ on solution of graph method without graphs ####\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the effect of varying $bias$ on the solutions we get in the block scheme which doesn't use graphs. To analyse the varying effect of $bias$, we generated a voter distribution and tried finding a district to fit it while varying $bias$. The results we achieve is as follows.\n",

The $conn$ factor we get do not vary too much between the different values of $bias$ that we choose. The possible objective values we get are discrete (meaning a certain range of $bias$ will just give the same solution) which is expected with integer variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can note a couple of things from this.\n",
    "- When the value of $bias$ is zero, the district that is drawn will have minimal efficiency gap (which in this case is zero). However, it will usually give a solution which has disconnected districts. This is because the objective doesn't consider the geometry of the districts at all because the objective function does not require it to.\n",
    "- As the value of $bias$ becomes higher, we get district shapes that are \"nicer\" and more block-shaped. By the time we get to $bias=2$ the district shape that we get is very simple, and could have been defined using two straight lines. However, the efficiency gap that we achieved also goes up and we get a district that is less fair.\n",
    "- For our case, there does exist a value of $bias$ which creates districts that are connected and also achieve minimal (not necessarily zero) effiency gap, which in this case is $bias=0.01$. This shows that this scheme can in fact give a solution as good as the other schemes given that we pick the right value of $bias$. We do not have a method to precisely determine a good value of $bias$ for a given problem rather than via experimentation or by estimation, but the fact that such value for $bias$ exists shows that this method can be promising."

For the block schemes involving graphs, we tend to get optimal solutions with minimal efficiency gap.

Most importantly, the two graph schemes both do not scale with the number of population but only with the variable $blk$, which means it can be adjusted to work better as we have models with mroe people (e.g. in real cities)."

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we have explored different geometries that we can use in order to draw voting districts that is fair and representative of the voters. We have used schemes of dividing voters into blocks that would belong to some certain district, and also a scheme where we divide the town using straight lines to allocate voters to different districts. We also discussed the performances of the different models, and more qualitative reasons why some models are better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of all the models explored, the block assignment models seems to be a good start if we were to implement such algorithms in real life examples. We can implement block schemes which is relatively fast and doesn't grow too quickly with size of problem (if we didn't use graphs), or get fairer districts (if we used graphs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In future works, a combination of techniques from graph and non-graph schemes can be used, so that we can ensure our districts are connected and valid, while also being a more convex-looking shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also look for ways to refine our schemes, or come up with a new scheme altogether, which will scale better with larger towns and will be able to run faster. This may include methods such as not having to minimise efficiency gap, but making representation match as close as possible to voter proportion, which will give solutions that is \"good enough\" for real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also extend the models we have beyond bi-partisan systems, but onto systems where there are more than two political parties, which is the case in many democratic countries outside the United States.\n",
